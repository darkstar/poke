Hello there!  This file contains useful information to hack GNU poke.

The bison parser in pkl-tab.y
=============================

The only purpose of the bison parser in pkl-tab.y is to do the
syntactic analysis, build the first AST, and set the locations of the
AST nodes.  Nothing else.  As we shall see below, any further analysis
and transformations on the AST are performaed by the compiler phases,
which are implemented elsewhere.

Compiler Passes and Phases
==========================

These are the phases currently implemented in the poke compiler:

    [parser]
    trans1     Transformation phase 1.
    anal1      Analysis phase 1.
    typify1    Type analysis and transformation 1.
    promo      Operand promotion phase.
    fold       Constant folding.
    typify2    Type analysis and transformation 2.
    trans2     Transformation phase 2.
    anal2      Analysis phase 2.
    gen        Code generation.

The phases above are organized in two passes:

    Pass1: trans1 anal1 typify1 promo fold typify2 trans2 anal2
    Pass2: gen
