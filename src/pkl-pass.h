/* A `pass' is a complete run over a given AST.  A `phase' is an
   analysis or a transformation performed over a subset of the nodes
   in the AST.  One pass may integrate several phases.

   Implementing a phase involves defining a struct pkl_phase variable
   and filling it up.  A pkl_phase struct contains:

   - CODE_PS_HANDLERS is a table indexed by node codes, which must be
     values in the `pkl_ast_code' enumeration defined in pkl-ast.h.
     For example, PKL_AST_ARRAY.  It maps codes to
     pkl_phase_handler_fn functions.

   - OP_PS_HANDLERS is a table indexed by operator codes, which must
     be values in the `pkl_ast_op' enumeration defined in pkl-ast.h.
     This enumeration is in turn generated from the operators defined
     in pkl-ops.def.  For example, PKL_AST_OP_ADD.  It maps codes to
     pkl_phase_handler_fn functions.

   - TYPE_PS_HANDLERS is a table indexed by type codes, which must be
     values in the `pkl_ast_type_code' enumeration defined in
     pkl-ast.h. For example, PKL_TYPE_STRING.  It maps codes to
     pkl_phase_handler_fn functions.

   The handlers defined in the tables above are invoked while
   traversing the AST in a post-order depth-first fashion.  Additional
   tables exist to define handlers that are executed while traversing
   the AST a pre-order depth-first fashion:

   - CODE_PR_HANDLERS
   - OP_PR_HANDLERS
   - TYPE_PR_HANDLERS

   A given phase can define handlers of both types: DF and BF.

   There are three additional handlers that the user can install:

   - DEFAULT_PR_HANDLER is invoked for every node in the AST, after the
     more particular ones, in pre-order.

   - DEFAULT_PS_HANDLER is invoked for every node in the AST, after
     the more particular ones, in post-order.

   - ELSE_HANDLER, if not NULL, is invoked for every node for which no
     other handler (PR or PS) has been invoked.

   Note that if a given node class falls in several categories as
   implemented in the handlers tables, the more general handler will
   be executed first, followed by the more particular handlers.  For
   example, for a PKL_AST_TYPE node with type code PKL_TYPE_ARRAY, the
   handler in `type_handlers' will be invoked first, followed by the
   handler in `code_handlers'.

   If the `else' handler is NULL and no other handler is executed,
   then no action is performed on a node other than traversing it.  */

/* The following macros are available to be used in the body of a node
   handler:

   PKL_PASS_PAYLOAD expands to an l-value holding the data pointer
   passed to `pkl_do_pass'.

   PKL_PASS_AST expands to an l-value holding the pkl_ast value
   corresponding to the AST being processed.

   PKL_PASS_NODE expands to an l-value holding the pkl_ast_node for
   the node being processed.

   PKL_PASS_PARENT expands to an l-value holding the pkl_ast_node for
   the parent of the node being processed.  This is NULL for the
   top-level node in the AST.

   PKL_PASS_CHILD_POS expands to an l-value holding the position (zero
   based) of the node being processed in the parent's node chain.  If
   the node is not part of a chain, this holds 0.

   PKL_PASS_DONE finishes the execution of the node handler.  This is
   equivalent to reaching the end of the handler body.

   PKL_PASS_BREAK causes the pass manager to not process the children
   of the current node.  This should only be used in a BF handler.

   PKL_PASS_RESTART expands to an l-value that should be set to 1 if
   the handler modifies its subtree structure in any way, either
   creating new nodes or removing existing nodes.  This makes the pass
   machinery do the right thing (hopefully.)  By default its value is
   0.  This macro should _not_ be used as an r-value.  Also, setting
   PKL_PASS_RESTART to 1 should only be done in DF handlers.

   PKL_PASS_SUBPASS (NODE) starts a subpass that processes the subtree
   starting at NODE.  If the execution of the subpass returns an error
   then the expansion of this macro calls PKL_PASS_ERROR.
   
   PKL_PASS_EXIT can be used in order to interrupt the execution of
   the compiler pass, making `pkl_do_pass' to return a non-error code.

   PKL_PASS_ERROR can be used in order to interrupt the execution of
   the compiler pass, making `pkl_do_pass' to return an error code.

   If you use PKL_PASS_EXIT or PKL_PASS_ERROR, please make sure to
   delete any node you create unless they are linked to the AST.
   Otherwise you will leak memory.  */
