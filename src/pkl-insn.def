/* The first column is the code for the instruction.

   The second column is a string describing the instruction arguments.
   If the instruction takes no arguments, this should be the empty
   string.  Each argument is identified by a letter:

   `v' is for a pvm_val.
   `a' is for a pkl_ast_node.
   `l' is for a label.
   `i' is for an integer.
   `r' is for register.
