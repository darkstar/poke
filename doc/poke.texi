@chapter Nomenclature
@cindex poke, Poke, pickle

GNU poke is a new program and it introduces many a new concept.  It is
a good idea to clarify how we call things in the poke community.
Unless everyone uses the same nomenclature to refer to pokeish
thingies, it is gonna get very confusing very soon!

First of all we have @command{poke}, the program.  Since ``poke'' is a
very common English word, when the context is not clear we either use
the full denomination @command{GNU poke}, or quote the word using some
other mean.

Then we have @dfn{Poke}, with upper case P, which is the name of the
domain-specific programming language implemented by @command{poke},
the program.

This distinction is important.  For example, when people talk about
``poke programmers'' they refer to the group of people hacking GNU
poke.  When they talk about ``Poke programmers'' they refer to the
people who write programs using the Poke programming language.

Finally, a @dfn{pickle} is a Poke source file containing definitions
of types, variables, functions, etc, that conceptually apply to some
definite domain.  For example, @file{elf.pk} is a pickle that provides
facilities to poke ELF object files.  Pickles are not necessarily
related to file formats: a set of functions to work with bit patterns,
for example, could be implemented in a pickle named
@file{bitpatterns.pk}.

We hope this helps to clarify things.
