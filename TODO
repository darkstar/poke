GNU Poke - TODO lists
=====================

NOTE: this file is not your typical abandoned TODO file that nobody
      reads and nobody updates.  We **do** use this file, and these
      are tasks that really need to get done.

If you start working on a complex task, please let us know in the
development mailing list so we can be aware of your efforts, and
probably help you.

If you complete a task, please include a patch for this file in your
patch submission, removing the corresponding entry.

The tasks below are generally ordered in reverse order of importance
within their categories, i.e. the most important tasks are listed
first.

For help on how to hack GNU poke, please see the file HACKING in this
very directory.

Happy poking!

build
-----

- Use jitter deopt options only where needed.  At the moment the
  JITTER_CFLAGS and friends are applied to all the sources of the
  `poke' program.  As jitter does some deoptimizations, it would be
  more efficient to use these flags only in jitter-generated vm files.
  This could be achieved using a libtool convenience library.

asm, gen
--------

- The assembly code snippets in both the code generator and the macro
  assembler make an excessive use of `regvar'.  It would be more
  efficient to use the return stack to store temporaries (tor/fromr).
  Patches in this spirit are welcome.
  
ras
---

- Validate the number of bits in u?int and u?long arguments.
- Make sure that label arguments are defined.
- Make sure that macro arguments are defined when used.
- Pretty print: indentation in .loop/.endloop etc.
