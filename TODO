Note that this file is not your typical abandoned TODO file that
nobody reads and nobody updates.  We _do_ use this file, and these are
tasks that really need to get done.

The tasks below are generally ordered in reverse order of importance,
i.e. the most important tasks are listed first.

asm, gen

- The assembly code snippets in both the code generator and the macro
  assembler make an excessive use of `regvar'.  It would be more
  efficient to use the return stack to store temporaries (tor/fromr).
  
ras

- Validate the number of bits in u?int and u?long arguments.
- Make sure that label arguments are defined.
- Make sure that macro arguments are defined when used.
- Write error messages to stderr.
- Pretty print: indentation in .loop/.endloop etc.
