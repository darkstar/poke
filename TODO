For help on how to hack GNU poke, please see the file HACKING in this
very directory.

Happy poking!

build
-----

- Use jitter deopt options only where needed.  At the moment the
  JITTER_CFLAGS and friends are applied to all the sources of the
  `poke' program.  As jitter does some deoptimizations, it would be
  more efficient to use these flags only in jitter-generated vm files.
  This could be achieved using a libtool convenience library.

asm, gen
--------

- The assembly code snippets in both the code generator and the macro
  assembler make an excessive use of `regvar'.  It would be more
  efficient to use the return stack to store temporaries (tor/fromr).
  Patches in this spirit are welcome.

ras
---

- Validate the number of bits in u?int and u?long arguments.
- Make sure that label arguments are defined.
- Make sure that macro arguments are defined when used.
- Pretty print: indentation in .loop/.endloop etc.
